## Project Aim

**SkyBlog** is a full-stack dynamic blog platform developed using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** with seamless integration of **Microsoft Azure Cloud Services**. This platform enables users to **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** blog posts efficiently.

The backend RESTful APIs are built using **Node.js & Express.js**, and the frontend is built with **React.js** for an interactive and responsive user interface. The blog data is securely stored in **Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API)**.  
The complete application is deployed on **Azure App Service** and **Azure Static Web Apps** for smooth performance, scalability, and availability. Additionally, **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights** are integrated for monitoring, error tracking, and performance optimization.
