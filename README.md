## Project Aim

**SkyBlog** is a full-stack dynamic blog platform developed using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** with seamless integration of **Microsoft Azure Cloud Infrastructure**.  
This platform enables users to **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** blog posts efficiently.

The backend RESTful APIs are built using **Node.js & Express.js**, and the frontend is built with **React.js** for an interactive user experience.  
The blog application is securely deployed on an **Azure Virtual Machine (Linux/Windows)**, with monitoring and backup services enabled to ensure high availability, security, and disaster recovery.
